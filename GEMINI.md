games to begin with (new games can be added from admin panel):
    🎲 1. 20 Questions (Classic Guessing Game)
        One of you thinks of a person, place, or object.
        The other has up to 20 yes/no questions to figure it out.
        Example: “Is it alive?” “Is it something you can eat?”
    💭 2. Would You Rather
        Take turns asking “Would you rather…?” questions.
        Example: “Would you rather have a date on the beach or in the mountains?”
        Keeps it fun but also helps you learn about her preferences.
    ❤️ 3. This or That (Fast Round)
        Throw quick options at her, she has to pick instantly.
        Example: “Pizza or burgers?” “Morning or night?” “Texting or calling?”
        Light, playful, and reveals more about her.
    🕵️ 4. Two Truths and a Lie
        Each person says three statements about themselves (two true, one false).
        The other guesses which is the lie.
        Great for bonding, especially early in a relationship.
